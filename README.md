### Intro

Project from Tripleten to make a webpage for an online application wherein the user ads clothing items to their profile and then the app narrows down their wardrobe based on their local weather.

### Technologies and methodology

The project utilizes Javascript, React, Vite, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive site that adapts to screen sizes and automatically filters the displayed cards based on data received through a weather API.

### GitHub Page

### Planned additions

Currently this is a demo site. In the future I will be adding additional functionality such as having the main weather banner update based on the time of day and temperature as well as the ability for the user to add their own clothing items with images and descriptions.
