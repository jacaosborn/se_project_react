### Intro

Project from Tripleten to make a webpage for an online application wherein the user ads clothing items to their profile and then the app narrows down their wardrobe based on their local weather.

### Technologies and methodology

The project utilizes Javascript, React, Vite, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive site that adapts to screen sizes and automatically filters the displayed cards based on data received through a weather API.

### Planned additions

Currently this is a demo site. In the future I will be adding additional functionality such as having the main weather banner update based on the time of day and temperature as well as adding additional UI and style elements.
